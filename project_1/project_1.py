"Who Wants to Breath a Million Air"
By Andr√© Neder
Student ID: 40208953

This is a minigame in the terminal using the World Air Quality Index API to quiz the player on a few questions that mimics the game show "How to Be a Millionaire".
The game uses:
The WAQI API: https://aqicn.org/api/
ASCII Art Library for python: https://pypi.org/project/art/
Rich Library for python: https://pypi.org/project/rich/

Enjoy!
