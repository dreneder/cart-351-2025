                            <td>In this first class we went through the outline, listing all the projects, tools, material and expectations for the course. When asked whether we were comfortable with JavaScript I asked for a possible refreshment since I feel the need to revisit due to the lack of practice, a very similar to what I had in CART-211.
After, we were presented to a few basic concepts of a web page an then how these are requested, accessed and used by a simple web page, starting to pave the way to what we will be seeing this semester. This demonstrated how a webpage performs different requests to servers and displays them to the user, also how we will be manipulating data.</td>

                            <td>In the first half of this session we installed Python, Miniconda and all other extensions to start the python materials. We were then introduced to the basics of Python following the examples posted in the website. A lot of the examples provided to create variables, statements or loops were compared to how we would do it in JavaScript, which was very helpful because it is the basis of programming that most students in this class have, including myself.</td>

                            <td>We continued learning python and started looking into web API’s. We started by Dictionaries and lists and how to do iterations on it. We then delved into web APIs, the concepts and did live coding on how to use a basic weather API. We did exercise 1 in class which consisted of gathering data from the World Air Quality Index API in order to parse and output different information. All while documenting and answering questions about the exercise.</td>

                            <td>On week 4, we were introduced to Flask, a Python framework used to build web applications. We learned how it allows Python to communicate with HTML pages, helping us display data directly on the web. During the class, we created a basic Flask environment, used it to manipulate data in Python, and showed the results dynamically through an HTML template. It was our first step in connecting code logic with web design.</td>

                            <td>Today our main focus was on exercise 2, which we had a lecture on using GET requests to create forms in HTML / CSS, we explored different methods to populate an gather Python data on a live page. In essence, the second exercise was using a template and create two pages, one to display info inside the python dictionaries and another to get information from a form and then display a page modified by such options, all with a touch of our own creativity.</td>

                            <td>Following up with Flask and get requests, the first part of the class was about how to use sessions to store input data from users, how to modify and delete it. We then inserted JavaScript into the mix in order to avoid using reloads and having the page load the stored form information and displaying it live in the page. Moving forward, we made templates of forms that use GET requests and then POST requests, understanding the difference and usage of each.</td>

                            <td>In this class we focused on reading and writing files in Python, starting with basic text files and then moving into JSON. We explored different file modes, how to read data in multiple ways, and the difference between overwriting and appending content. We also learned how JSON files can be read and updated to store structured data. The final example connected a p5.js game to Flask, showing how user data can be sent to the server and saved, making the idea of persistent data clearer.</td>

                            <td>In this class we started using MongoDB Atlas to store data in the cloud. We created a database and collection, then connected MongoDB to a Flask app using Flask-PyMongo. We also set up a .env file to hide our login info. After that, we tested inserting and retrieving documents, and tried basic updates and searches. By the end, it was clear how MongoDB can power a dynamic web app instead of relying on local files.</td>

                            <td>The tutorial in this session was shorter than average but overly interesting for we learned to implement WebSockets in order to make different instances of the page communicate. Using sockets with Flask, we explored real-time interaction through a simple chat and a shared p5.js sketch where actions appeared instantly across clients. In the second half of the class, we were set off to see the Project 2 from our classmates and write reviews on them. It was definitely fascinating to see the different approaches that people had to storing and retrieving information with Flask and JSON.</td>
