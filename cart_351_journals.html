                            <td>In this first class we went through the outline, listing all the projects, tools, material and expectations for the course. When asked whether we were comfortable with JavaScript I asked for a possible refreshment since I feel the need to revisit due to the lack of practice, a very similar to what I had in CART-211.
After, we were presented to a few basic concepts of a web page an then how these are requested, accessed and used by a simple web page, starting to pave the way to what we will be seeing this semester. This demonstrated how a webpage performs different requests to servers and displays them to the user, also how we will be manipulating data.</td>

                            <td>In the first half of this session we installed Python, Miniconda and all other extensions to start the python materials. We were then introduced to the basics of Python following the examples posted in the website. A lot of the examples provided to create variables, statements or loops were compared to how we would do it in JavaScript, which was very helpful because it is the basis of programming that most students in this class have, including myself.</td>

                            <td>We continued learning python and started looking into web APIâ€™s. We started by Dictionaries and lists and how to do iterations on it. We then delved into web APIs, the concepts and did live coding on how to use a basic weather API. We did exercise 1 in class which consisted of gathering data from the World Air Quality Index API in order to parse and output different information. All while documenting and answering questions about the exercise.</td>

                            <td>On week 4, we were introduced to Flask, a Python framework used to build web applications. We learned how it allows Python to communicate with HTML pages, helping us display data directly on the web. During the class, we created a basic Flask environment, used it to manipulate data in Python, and showed the results dynamically through an HTML template. It was our first step in connecting code logic with web design.</td>
